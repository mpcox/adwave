## Wavelet analysis of genomic data from admixed populations

*adwave* is an R package that implements wavelet-based approaches for describing population admixture.

*adwave* uses Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to define population structure and produce a localized admixture signal for each individual. Wavelet summaries of the PCA output describe variation present in the data and can be related to population-level demographic processes.
